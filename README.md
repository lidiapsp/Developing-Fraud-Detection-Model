## 🔎 Developing Fraud Detection Model Using Python

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model for fraud detection on **GrowBank’s B2C transactions**, focusing on savings and credit card activities. It analyzes transaction patterns and key indicators to effectively distinguish fraudulent from non-fraudulent transactions. The solution integrates Python modeling with dashboards in Excel and Tableau for stakeholder communication.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify key fraud indicators from transactional data  
- Build a predictive model to classify transactions as fraud/non-fraud  
- Provide actionable insights to reduce fraud risk  

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn)  
- Excel & Tableau (visualization, dashboards)

## 📁 Files
- pdf: Analysis and modeling summary  
- pynb: Interactive Python notebook
- twbx: Tableau dashboard for fraud KPIs  

## 📌 Key Insights
- **High fraud rate** indicates rule-based systems are insufficient  
- **Risk Score** and **Failed Attempts** are strong indicators of fraud  
- Model 2 with **binned Risk Score** achieves better balance of precision and recall  

## 💡 Recommendations
- Implement **adaptive risk thresholds** instead of static rules  
- Add **behavioral features** (e.g., time gap between attempts)  
- Integrate **anomaly detection techniques** to reduce false positives
